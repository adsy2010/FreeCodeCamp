#Responsive Web Design Projects 
##Build a Tribute Page

Project requires a product landing page. Not really sure what I needed to 
make, but I gave it a go anyway!  

Requirements:

- Must have a company logo (fake or otherwise)
- Needs 3 anchor links to navigate the page
- Must contain a video (again fake or otherwise) 
- Must have a form to get an email address minimum with validation
- Form must be submittable to a specific URL (no real data sent)
- Navbar must always be present at the top
- At least one media query required for sizing
- Should contain flexbox at least once

Fulfilled all requirements and passed.
